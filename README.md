# jobai-lightning-build
build for a simple job ai app for a tailored lightning build session

## 👨‍💻 Stack (Based on C13 Learner Feedback)
**Frontend**: Next.js / React + Tailwind
**Backend**: Node.js + Express
**Database**: N/A
**AI Features**: OpenAI API for resume analysis, cover letter generation, and strategy recommendations
**Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend)
**Time**: Full day (approximately 5 hours)

## ⚡ How It Works
1️⃣ Upload Portfolio (Resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)
The user inputs their portfolio links, uploads their resume, or provides a summary of skills.
AI scans and extracts key skills, technologies, and projects.
2️⃣ Compare with Job Postings
User inputs job descriptions from LinkedIn, Indeed, or other sources.
AI highlights matches (skills, experience, keywords).
AI identifies gaps and suggests improvements.
3️⃣ Cover Letter Generator
AI writes a personalized cover letter based on the applicant’s experience and the specific job posting.
4️⃣ Interview Likelihood Score + Strategy
Provides a score (0-100) on how well the portfolio aligns.
Suggests next steps (e.g., “Improve Python skills,” “Get AWS certification,” “Contribute to open-source”).
Bonus: Suggests cold email templates to recruiters.
5️⃣ "Level-Up Plan"
AI generates a learning roadmap to improve weak areas.
Recommends online courses, GitHub projects, and networking tips.

## 🔥 Bonus Features
✅ Job Market Insights:
Uses real-time job trends (from LinkedIn APIs or web scraping) to show most in-demand skills.
✅ Salary Estimator:

## 💡 Why It’s Impactful
Helps job seekers identify their strengths & weaknesses.
Reduces job hunt frustration by giving realistic expectations.
Bridges the gap between what recruiters want and what applicants offer.

## Hour-by-hour guidance
Here's a structured Lightning Build scaffold with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, OpenAI API, Vercel, and Express.js that learners can use at each milestone. This is intended to help learners keep unblocked and moving forward while providing them at each step a chance to try to build it themselves. 

### 🕐 First Hour: UI Wireframe + Basic API Routes
This milestone sets up the basic UI layout and creates a server route for testing API calls. **See the hour_1_setup directory**
#### 1️⃣ Scaffold the Next.js & Express.js App
Ensure dependencies are installed:
```
npx create-next-app@latest jobfit-ai --typescript --tailwind --use-npm
cd jobfit-ai
npm install express cors openai dotenv
```
Create a server folder for Express:
```
mkdir server && touch server/index.ts
```

2️⃣ Next.js UI Wireframe
Edit page.tsx

3️⃣ Set Up Express API Server
Edit server/index.ts
Edit the package.json to include:
```
"type": "module",
```
Run the API server:
```
npx tsx server/index.ts
```
You may need to run the following commands: 
```
npm i --save-dev @types/express
npm i --save-dev @types/cors
```

✅ At the end of this milestone, learners should have:
A Next.js UI where users can upload resumes.
A working Express API.

### 🕑 Second Hour: Resume Parsing + Job Description Comparison
Now, let’s extract data from the resume and compare it to a job description.
1️⃣ Add API Call in Next.js
Edit pages/index.tsx
2️⃣ Implement Resume Parsing in Express
Edit server/index.ts
Create your .env file at the root of the project:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

✅ At the end of this milestone, learners should have:
Resume parsing & job matching with AI-powered comparison.


### 🕒 Third Hour: AI-Generated Cover Letters + Strategy
Now, generate a customized cover letter and improvement strategy.
1️⃣ Add AI Cover Letter Button
Edit pages/index.tsx

2️⃣ Add Cover Letter API Endpoint
Edit server/index.ts

✅ At the end of this milestone, learners should have:
AI-generated cover letters based on the job description.

### 🕓 Final 30 Minutes: Deployment & Testing
Deploy Next.js Frontend to Vercel
vercel
Deploy Express API
Modify package.json:
```
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server/index.js"
}
```
Deploy using Render:

✅ At the end of this milestone, learners should have:
A fully working JobFit AI tool is deployed and accessible online.
